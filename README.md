# Around The U.S.

This is project 3 of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and object-oriented programing following a figma design. It has a profile section with a customizable title, description, and button that allows for adding personalized images. If you are looking to create a profile where all you'll need to do is add your own personal touch, this ready to use template will make the process seamless!

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- Grid
- Media Queries
- Responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- JavaScript
- Object-oriented programming

## Plan on improving the project

Make the project functional in the future using JavaScript. In the future, I'd also like to implement a search bar and add functionality. This will help to easily find a specific card if many cards are added.
